# Intelligent Robotics System

In this project, I cooperated with a senior students to construct this intelligent system. By detecting the mechanical parts and estimating the pose of the mechanical parts, the six-axis robotic arm can grasping the mechanical parts.

The paper of this system is still prepare, so I just can show the work of this system.
